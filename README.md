# 🌍 API Testing with Postman & Newman

This project implements automated API tests using Postman and Newman to test the API documented at [Automation Exercise API](https://automationexercise.com/api_list). The test suite includes a variety of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, with validations for response status codes and checks for response body formats. The API accepts data in form-data format.

## 🧪 Test Cases

The test suite consists of the following 7 test cases, covering different types of requests. Each test case is designed to verify both the status and the structure of the response.

1. #### 🛒 GET /productsList

    Retrieves the entire list of products available in the system.

2. #### 🚫 POST /productsList - Verifying Unsupported Methods

    Verifies that a POST request is not supported for the /productsList endpoint, which should only support GET requests.

3. #### 🔑 DELETE /verifyLogin - Invalid Request Method

    Attempts to delete a user login session using the /verifyLogin endpoint with a DELETE request, which is not supported by the API.

4. #### 👤 POST /createAccount

    Creates a new user account by submitting user details (e.g., name, email, password) via form-data.

5. #### 🗑 DELETE /deleteAccount

    Deletes an existing user account. Requires user authentication and the user email to be passed in the request.

6. #### ✏️ PUT /updateAccount

    Updates an existing user account’s details (e.g., name, email, password). This requires passing the updated information via form-data.

7. #### 📧 GET /getAccountDetailByEmail
    Fetches the account details of a user based on their email address.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you can run the test cases locally, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** – [Download Node.js]
-   **Git** – [Download Git](https://git-scm.com)
-   **Postman** – [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
-   Newman (Postman's CLI) – You can install it globally using npm:
    ```
    npm install -g newman
    ```

### 💻 Installation

To get the project set up locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone
    https://github.com/RamintaVIL/websiteAPI-testing-with-postman
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### ▶️ Running Locally

You can run the tests using Newman, either in interactive or headless mode:

1. Headless Mode:
   Run all tests in the terminal without a graphical interface:

```bash
npm run test
```

After running the tests in headless mode, you will see the results in your terminal, including details on any failed or passed tests.

### 📝 Test Results

Once the tests are complete, the results will be displayed in the terminal or in the HTML report generated by Newman. You will see details on passed or failed tests. If a test fails, you can inspect the logs to troubleshoot the issue. The pipeline logs in GitHub Actions will provide additional details, such as error messages or failed assertions, helping you identify the cause of failure.
