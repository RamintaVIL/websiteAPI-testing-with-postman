# API Testing with Postman & Newman

This project implements automated API tests using Postman to test the API documented at Automation Exercise API. The test suite includes a mix of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, with checks for response status codes and assertions for response body formats. The API accepts data in form-data format.

## Test Cases

The test suite consists of the following 7 test cases, covering different types of requests. Each test case is designed to verify both the status and the structure of the response.

1. GET /productsList
   Method: GET
   Endpoint: /productsList
   Description: Retrieves the entire list of products available in the system.

2. POST /productsList
   Method: POST
   Endpoint: /productsList
   Description: Adds a new product to the product list using form-data. The request should include necessary product details like name, price, and category.

3. DELETE /verifyLogin
   Method: DELETE
   Endpoint: /verifyLogin
   Description: Deletes the login session of a user, effectively logging them out.

4. POST /createAccount
   Method: POST
   Endpoint: /createAccount
   Description: Creates a new user account by submitting user details (e.g., name, email, password) via form-data.

5. DELETE /deleteAccount
   Method: DELETE
   Endpoint: /deleteAccount
   Description: Deletes an existing user account. Requires user authentication and the user ID to be passed in the request.

6. PUT /updateAccount
   Method: PUT
   Endpoint: /updateAccount
   Description: Updates an existing user account’s details (e.g., name, email, password). This requires passing the updated information via form-data.

7. GET /getAccountDetailByEmail
   Method: GET
   Endpoint: /getAccountDetailByEmail
   Description: Fetches the account details of a user based on their email address.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### 💫 Prerequisites

Before you can run the test cases locally, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** – [Download Node.js]
-   **Git** – Download Git
-   **Postman** -
-   Newman (Postman's CLI) – You can install it globally using npm:
    ```
    npm install -g newman
    ```

### 💻 Installation

To get the project set up locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone
    https://github.com/RamintaVIL/websiteAPI-testing-with-postman
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 💨 Running Locally

You can run the tests using Newman, either in interactive or headless mode:

1. Headless Mode:
   Run all tests in the terminal without a graphical interface:

```bash
npm run test
```

After running the tests in headless mode, you will see the results in your terminal, including details on any failed or passed tests.

### 📝 Test Results

Once the tests are complete, the results will be displayed in the terminal or in the HTML report generated by Newman. You will see details on passed or failed tests. If a test fails, you can inspect the logs to troubleshoot the issue. The pipeline logs in GitHub Actions will provide additional details, such as error messages or failed assertions, helping you identify the cause of failure.
