# API Testing with Postman & Newman

This guide explains how to test the API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman), a command-line collection runner for Postman.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed:

-   **Postman**: You can download it from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
-   **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **Newman**: Install Newman globally by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g newman
    ```

📝 Test Results

Once the tests are complete, the results will be displayed, including the number of tests that passed or failed. If a test fails, you can inspect the logs or screenshots (automatically generated by Cypress) to troubleshoot the issue.
